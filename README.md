**Workshopper** was used by **[learnyounode](https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode)**, and other Node.js command-line workshop applications.

**Adventure** was used by **[javascripting](hhttps://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting), and other Node.js command-line workshop applications.

**Workshopper-Adventure** allows you to create a workshop written
like either of those frameworks!

[@linclark](https://github.com/linclark) has written a good introduction on creating your own workshop, available [here](https://github.com/linclark/lin-clark.com/blob/master/content/blog/2014/07/01/authoring-nodejs-workshopper-lessons.md).

## High-level overview

Workshopper-Adventure is essentially a *test-runner* with a fancy terminal UI. The Workshopper package itself is largely concerned with the menu system and some of the basic command-line parsing. Much of the work for executing the exercise validation is handled by [workshopper-exercise](http://github.com/rvagg/workshopper-exercise).
